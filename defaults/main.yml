# Defaults variables for role wg-host
#
# this role will help you set up some wg interfaces on a host that can be used as wireguard server and/or client
# Only difference is if we defined udp port (see below) or not and so which one is initiating connection
# Client will be able to just connect to it to get access to local subnet (with our without NAT helper - see iptables role - forward/nat rules not managed by this role for subnet to subnet !)


# To generate private/public keys, see 'wg genkey | tee -a myprivkey | wg pubkey | tee -a mypubkey'

# variables
# First example for wg0 : we are server so listening over udp
# second example for wg1 : we are just client and ourselves connecting to a server but also declaring potential remote subnet we'd like to get access to
